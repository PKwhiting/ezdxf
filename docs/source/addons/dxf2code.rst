dxf2code
========

Translate DXF entities and structures into Python source code.

`dxf2code` recreates the translated entity graph, including simple object-backed
``FIELD`` wrappers hosted by ``TEXT``, ``ATTRIB``, ``ATTDEF`` and ``MTEXT``.
For ``AcObjProp`` fields, the referenced target entity also has to be part of
the translated entity set so the new field payload can be rebound to the new
handles in the generated document.

Direct ``MLEADERSTYLE`` object generation is also supported by
`table_entries_to_code`, including the same style-resource rebinding rules used
by generated ``MULTILEADER`` entities.

`dxf2code` also recreates ``MULTILEADER`` entities by rebuilding the nested
context and leader-line structures in generated code.
Hosted ``FIELD`` wrappers are preserved for MTEXT-content multileaders by the
same deferred field reconstruction used for other supported text hosts.
The generated code resolves the referenced ``MLEADERSTYLE``, text style and
linetype by name in the target document. Missing referenced ``MLEADERSTYLE``
entries are recreated in generated code from the source style data before the
``MULTILEADER`` entity is rebuilt. Referenced arrow-head blocks on the style or
on the ``MULTILEADER`` entity itself are rebound by block name as well.
Referenced non-arrow style blocks are rebound if the target document already
contains the matching block definition; otherwise that optional style handle is
omitted to avoid failing code generation.

For BLOCK-content multileaders the referenced block definition still has to
exist in the target document, just like normal block references. The generated
code remaps virtual block-attribute handles to the target block ATTDEF handles
by ATTDEF order.
Additional ``MultiLeader.arrow_heads`` collections are also rebound by block
name.

The current supported field and ``MULTILEADER`` round-trip surface is also
validated by a dedicated AutoCAD/Core Console artifact under
``experiments/ezdxf-generated-fields/dxf2code_roundtrip_validation.dxf`` and
its generated Python source companion
``experiments/ezdxf-generated-fields/dxf2code_roundtrip_validation_generated.py``.

Short example:

.. code-block:: Python

    import ezdxf
    from ezdxf.addons.dxf2code import entities_to_code, block_to_code

    doc = ezdxf.readfile('original.dxf')
    msp = doc.modelspace()
    source = entities_to_code(msp)

    # create source code for a block definition
    block_source = block_to_code(doc.blocks['MyBlock'])

    # create source code for required object-style entries
    style_source = table_entries_to_code([
        doc.mleader_styles.get('MyMLeaderStyle'),
    ])

    # merge source code objects
    source.merge(style_source)
    source.merge(block_source)

    with open('source.py', mode='wt') as f:
        f.write(source.import_str())
        f.write('\n\n')
        f.write(source.code_str())
        f.write('\n')

.. class:: Code

    Source code container.

    .. attribute:: code

        Source code line storage, store lines without line ending ``\\n``

    .. attribute:: imports

        source code line storage for global imports, store lines without line ending ``\\n``

    .. attribute:: layers

        Layers used by the generated source code, AutoCAD accepts layer names without a LAYER table entry.

    .. attribute:: linetypes

        Linetypes used by the generated source code, these linetypes require a TABLE entry or AutoCAD will crash.

    .. attribute:: styles

        Text styles used by the generated source code, these text styles require a TABLE entry or AutoCAD will crash.

    .. attribute:: dimstyles

        Dimension styles  used by the generated source code, these dimension styles require a TABLE entry or AutoCAD will crash.

    .. attribute:: blocks

        Blocks used by the generated source code, these blocks require a BLOCK definition in the BLOCKS section or AutoCAD will crash.

Generation order matters for some structures. For example, block definitions
required by block-content ``MULTILEADER`` entities should be generated before
the entity code, and direct ``MLEADERSTYLE`` objects can be generated through
`table_entries_to_code(...)` before the consuming entities are recreated.
